    <p>Tonkatsu is a Japanese fried pork cutlet dish. It can be served with tonkatsu sauce or with curry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Tonkatsu</h3>
        <li>3/4 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 boneless pork loin chops (1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <h3>Curry</h3>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Vermont Curry cube mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. 
            Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). 
            For a convection oven, reduce the temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). 
            Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with an oven-safe wire rack as it allows hot air to circulate around the cutlets and prevents the panko underneath from getting crushed.</li>
        <li>Prepare the curry as instructed on the box.</li>
        <li>Add 3/4 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) and 1 Tbsp neutral oil to a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Turn on the stove's heat to medium and stir the panko and toast until golden brown. 
            Transfer the toasted panko to a shallow dish and allow it to cool.</li>
        <li>From 2 boneless pork loin chops (1/2-inch thick), cut off the extra fat and make several slits on the connective tissue between the meat and remaining fat.</li>
        <li>To tenderize the meat, pound both sides of the cutlets with a meat pounder; if you don’t have one, then use the back of the knife. Mold the flattened meat back into the original shape with your hands.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cutlets with 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 large egg and 1/2 Tbsp neutral oil. Press on the panko flakes to make sure they adhere to the pork.</li>
        <li>Next, add 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Dredge each pork piece in the flour and pat off the excess. Next, dip the cutlets into the egg to coat them completely.</li>
        <li>Then, cover completely with the toasted panko and transfer to the oven-safe wire rack.</li>
        <li>Place the pork cutlets on the wire rack or parchment paper in the prepared baking sheet. Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) until the pork is no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest the Tonkatsu for 3 minutes on the countertop. Then, cut the Tonkatsu into 1-inch pieces (so you can eat them with chopsticks) by pressing the knife directly down into the cutlets, instead of sawing back and forth. This way, the panko crust will not come off.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and curry and enjoy!</li>
